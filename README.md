# VistaKITTI

A modular computer vision toolkit for stereo-based scene understanding using the KITTI dataset. This project features milestone-based implementations for key perception tasks including depth estimation via stereo vision and semantic segmentation using YOLOv8, ultimately aimed at fusing these modalities for enriched scene interpretation.

The project is structured in milestones, each building toward a comprehensive vision system:

### âœ… Completed

I. Depth Estimation from stereo camera images

II. Semantic Segmentation of key scene components

### ðŸ”œ Upcoming Modules

III. Instance Segmentation / Object Detection

IV. Fusion of Depth and Semantics for intelligent scene reasoning

V. Temporal Tracking using stereo videos

### ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8n-seg)

Install using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib ultralytics
```
